## 📊 KEY INSIGHTS

- **Awareness vs. Trial Gap:**  
  Mumbai and Delhi had 60% awareness but trial rates were just 3% and 1% respectively — suggesting poor conversion in major cities.

- **Regional Performance:**  
  Bangalore stood out, accounting for 40% of trials despite making up only 28% of respondents — indicating a strong product-market fit.

- **Demographic Trends:**  
  83.8% of respondents who discovered CodeX through online ads were aged 14–31, highlighting the power of digital marketing among youth.

- **Purchase Channels:**  
  Supermarkets dominated as the primary point of sale (45%), followed by online retailers (25%).

- **Health & Packaging Preferences:**  
  60% of respondents preferred **reduced-sugar** drinks and favored **compact, portable cans** with innovative packaging features.

## 📌 RECOMMENDATIONS

- Conduct qualitative research in **Mumbai** and **Delhi** to understand low trial conversion and address barriers such as health concerns or brand unfamiliarity.

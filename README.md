- Deliver actionable recommendations using **interactive dashboards and visuals**.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The survey revealed that 45% of respondents are aware of the CodeX energy drink, with online ads and TV commercials being the primary sources of information. Notably, cities like Mumbai and Delhi show high awareness (60%) but low trial rates (3% and 1%, respectively). This discrepancy indicates a need for refined marketing strategies in these key urban areas.

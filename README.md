PROJECT BACKGROUND

CodeX, a German beverage company, aiming to make its mark in the Indian market has recently launched its energy drink in 10 cities across India. The objective of this project is to analyze survey data regarding customer awareness and product performance, providing actionable insights to enhance brand recognition and product offerings in the Indian market.


Insights and Recommendations are provided on the following areas:

1. Product Performance: An analysis of Product performance and areas for development
2. Demographic Comparison: An evaluation of brand awareness and performance by Gender, Age and City

OBJECTIVES

Evaluate brand awareness and trial performance by city, age, and gender.
- Identify **market gaps** and **conversion challenges** in high-awareness regions.
- Understand consumer preferences regarding **pricing**, **packaging**, and **product variants**.
- Deliver actionable recommendations using **interactive dashboards and visuals**.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The survey revealed that 45% of respondents are aware of the CodeX energy drink, with online ads and TV commercials being the primary sources of information. Notably, cities like Mumbai and Delhi show high awareness (60%) but low trial rates (3% and 1%, respectively). This discrepancy indicates a need for refined marketing strategies in these key urban areas.

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

- Participate in high-energy events (festivals, sports, campus) to boost trial and brand association.
- Develop a **reduced-sugar or sugar-free** variant to cater to health-conscious consumers.
- Invest in **ergonomic and visually appealing packaging** (e.g., glow-in-the-dark cans) to attract nightlife and youth segments.


RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Conduct qualitative research in Mumbai and Delhi to uncover barriers to product trial, focusing on unfamiliarity, brand perception, and health concerns before allocating more resources to advertising.

2. Enhance digital marketing efforts across all cities, particularly in Bangalore and Hyderabad, utilising influencer partnerships in health and lifestyle sectors and engaging online campaigns like product souvenir giveaways.

3. Participate in high-energy events (music festivals, sports events, campus activities) to connect with target consumers aged 18-45.

4. Explore a reduced-sugar or sugar-free variant to cater to health-conscious consumers, addressing the significant demand for healthier energy drink options.

5. Invest in ergonomic, eye-catching packaging designs, such as glow-in-the-dark features for nightlife appeal, to attract younger consumers during physical, nightlife and active engagements.
Kolkata and Hyderabad rarely consume energy drinks.
